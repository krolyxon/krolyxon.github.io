<h2 id="my-thoughts-on-music">My thoughts on Music<a href="#my-thoughts-on-music" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>I Love music. It can be a great tool if you use it in your life just to entertain yourself once in a while and relax. But for me, the story is quite different, lets start with it.</p>
<p>I used to listen to it every single day, not spending single bit of free time without listening to music. The first thing i would do when i wake up is to start my favorite playlist and then start getting ready, i had gotten used to doing my daily chores or any kind of work to be honest while having music being played in the background. It was as if like my life was a movie at this point and that music was the background music being played.</p>
<p>Now this had become a problem, i couldn&rsquo;t find myself being productive at all without having music in my background. It was as if music was the only source of motivation at that point and i started noticing that.
The amount of dopamine hits good music can give you is unimaginable, especially if the music is from Hans Zimmer, he is too good and you just can&rsquo;t help but listen to it for hours and hours. While i still don&rsquo;t think music is a bad thing, but in my case things have gone wrong, really wrong. So i got no option but to abandon it from my daily routine. I have made strict rules about when i am allowed to listen to music (which is never, by myself). The only way i am allowed to listen to music is when i am with my associates and he/she is listening to it, so i might join them but i am not allowed to play it by myself.</p>
<p>Thankfully i didn&rsquo;t have any digital footprint of the music i listen to because i never used Spotify and any other online music streaming services, i didn&rsquo;t have to spend any time deleting online accounts, just had to <code>rm -rf ~/music &amp;&amp; sudo pacman -Rns mpd rmptui</code>, and there it is, Its Gone!</p>
<p>Its ironic that i am writing this blog called &ldquo;Abandoning Music&rdquo; even though i myself have created a TUI music player previously (<a href="https://github.com/krolyxon/rmptui">rmptui</a>, now archived). I guess i am also abandoning the development on it as well. Anyways, as of today (16/12/2024) the latest commit on that repo was 6 months ago, so i think its abandoned already ðŸ˜….</p>
<h2 id="should-you-do-the-same">Should you do the same?<a href="#should-you-do-the-same" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really think so. If you only occasionally listen to it and not have it playing in the background all the time as if its a part of your daily routine, you are doing just fine. Enjoy it, its good for you.</p>
