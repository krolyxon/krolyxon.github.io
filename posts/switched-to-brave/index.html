<p>Alright i have been making alot of switches these days, first it was switching to NvChad now this.
I previously used Librewolf, which was a more privacy focused browser based on Firefox, and to be honest it worked quite well.
It supported all the extensions/addons i needed, it had firefox sync, and the overall experience was nice.</p>
<p>One thing that was bugging me was performance, previously i was unaware that librewolf performed worse compared to other chromium based browser.
I had to install a chromium based browser for my college work for some time, and there i experienced some speed, real speed.
And i fell into the trap and now i am using a chromium based browser as my default browser. There are lots of things that i am missing from librewolf,
such as smooth scrolling and mouse gestures (i miss them), its UI and firefox sync, but speed is something i always prioritize over anything else, so brave it is.</p>
<p>Also, one nice thing about brave (or any other chromium based browser) is that you can have multiple profiles. Now i can have separate profiles for different use cases.
One profile for College, one for personal stuff, one for work.</p>
<p>So far, the experience on brave has been satisfactory and i don&rsquo;t plan to switch to any other browser anytime soon.</p>
