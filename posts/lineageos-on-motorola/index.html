And let me tell you, no its no way near &lsquo;privacy&rsquo; friendly.

<p>As i have said in my home page, i dont use cell phones that much but i do own a moto g60,
because it has become impossible to live without a cell phone in this modern era.</p>
<p>The reason i chose to buy a motorola phone instead of those sh*tty compenies like xiaomi, vivo, oppo etc.
was because my friend (well i dont have any, its just a ehh friend not friend friend) told me that Motorola phones are &lsquo;privacy&rsquo; friendly and provide clean android experience.
and yeah of course, i fell for it. And let me tell you, no its no way near &lsquo;privacy&rsquo; friendly.</p>
<p>The only good thing was that it didnt come with preinstalled garbage,
its a good thing but you know you can always use <code>adb</code> to remove any preinstalled app and it wont ever bother you,
unless you update your phone.</p>
<p>So anyways, i tried using the default os it came with for a week or so. and to be honest,
it was horrible. it just didnt feel any different from something like MIUI,
yeah i do agree that its way cleaner but at the end i dont feel like i am private in any way.
so i asked for help in #gnulinuxindia in matrix. and one guy, i wish i remembered his name suggested me giving Lineage OS a try,
i went to it&rsquo;s official website and looked for my model. yes, you guessed it right. it wasnt supported. but somehow i did find a guy on xda-developers.
This guy named Raghu Varma had built the ROM for moto g60. So i grabbed some tea and started following the installation steps and somehow managed to install it.
and god oh god, ITS AWESOMEEE!!!</p>
<p>I have been using it for over a month now, and everything seems to work fine. yes it indeed is a little buggy, but i can work with it.
i also decided to root it after a week. problem is now i am unable to get OTA updates without messing up my root, so i just stopped updating.
But finally i am able to have some privacy on my device.</p>
<p>isnt this beautiful? i finally feel like i &lsquo;own&rsquo; my device.</p>
