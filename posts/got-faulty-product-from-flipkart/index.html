<meta name="description" content="Today i got a faulty 16GB ram from Flipkart. So the RAM i ordered was Crucial 16GB 3200Mhz laptop RAM. It turns out to be faulty and i cant even return it ðŸ’€.
So here is the story in the format of 4 stages of grief :)
Stage 1: Excitement, Happiness. it was 10 am in the morning, i was sleeping. I get a call from my mum that the RAM i ordered online has just arrived and i gotta be there to confirm the delivery and to verify that the product is right. I woke up immediately, in a rush without fixing my bed. i ran with happiness and excitement, and full of thoughts of what i am going to do after upgrading my laptop&rsquo;s ram. Confirmed the order, took the RAM, went back to my room. I was happy. I was excited.

        <p>Today i got a faulty 16GB ram from Flipkart.
So the RAM i ordered was <a href="https://www.flipkart.com/crucial-16gb-ddr4-3200mhz-cl22-16-gb-laptop-ct16g4sfs832a/p/itmceac5769ac001?pid=RAMGKX6ZCJPDGCTZ&amp;q=crucial&#43;16&#43;gb&#43;laptop&#43;ram&amp;qH=6bd7dde490d2b5bc">Crucial 16GB 3200Mhz laptop RAM</a>. It turns out to be faulty and i cant even return it ðŸ’€.</p>
<p>So here is the story in the format of 4 stages of grief :)</p>
<h2 id="stage-1-excitement-happiness">Stage 1: Excitement, Happiness.<a href="#stage-1-excitement-happiness" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>it was 10 am in the morning, i was sleeping. I get a call from my mum that the RAM i ordered online has just arrived and i gotta be there to confirm the delivery and to verify that the product is right. I woke up immediately, in a rush without fixing my bed. i ran with happiness and excitement, and full of thoughts of what i am going to do after upgrading my laptop&rsquo;s ram. Confirmed the order, took the RAM, went back to my room. I was happy. I was excited.</p>
<h2 id="stage-2-fear--shocked">Stage 2: Fear , Shocked.<a href="#stage-2-fear--shocked" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>After getting back to my room, i started opening my laptop&rsquo;s back which has small plus/star screws with a huge flat head screwdriver ðŸ’€. i managed to open all the screws and the back panel withing 10 minutes, i installed the ram. After that my laptop booted into my Arch Linux (btw) without any issues, and i was still happy. To confirm that the ram has been installed correctly, i quickly ran <code>neofetch</code>, and this is where my happiness started turning into fear. the ram was still <code>8 Gb</code>, when it should have been <code>8 + 16 = 24 Gb</code>.
Thinking that i just installed it incorrectly, i tried all different variations again, such as swapping the ram slots, using only the new ram, and all that. but it still wasn&rsquo;t working, and then i was sure that i just got an defected product. I was Afraid. I was Shocked.</p>
<h2 id="stage-3-anger-tears">Stage 3: Anger, Tears<a href="#stage-3-anger-tears" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>Now since it was for sure that i had gotten an defected RAM, i quickly opened up Flipkart and tried to find the Return button, and it turns out that this particular seller did not provide any return policies. I am not sure 100%, but i do believe it did said that it provides return policies and then the seller changed it, but we cant say for sure. I was really panicking.
I called Flipkart customer support, and had a talk with the technician, and there he also confirmed that Flipkart cant help me since the product does not come under the refundable product&rsquo;s category. then i knew for sure, I am f*cked.
I was Angry. I was Crying.</p>
<h2 id="stage-4-acceptance">Stage 4: Acceptance<a href="#stage-4-acceptance" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>After fuming and crying for about an hour, and talking with my friends on Matrix about it. i finally had just accepted it, and decided to write a article on it to share my feelings. I was broken but i was okay.</p>
