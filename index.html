<p>I Love music. It can be a great tool if you use it in your life just to entertain yourself once in a while and relax. But for me, the story is quite different, lets start with it.</p>

<p>Alright i have been making alot of switches these days, first it was switching to NvChad now this.
I previously used Librewolf, which was a more privacy focused browser based on Firefox, and to be honest it worked quite well.
It supported all the extensions/addons i needed, it had firefox sync, and the overall experience was nice.</p>
<p>One thing that was bugging me was performance, previously i was unaware that librewolf performed worse compared to other chromium based browser.
I had to install a chromium based browser for my college work for some time, and there i experienced some speed, real speed.
And i fell into the trap and now i am using a chromium based browser as my default browser. There are lots of things that i am missing from librewolf,
such as smooth scrolling and mouse gestures (i miss them), its UI and firefox sync, but speed is something i always prioritize over anything else, so brave it is.</p>

<p>Throughout my journey of using Neovim, i always avoided using a pre-built config or any distribution of neovim such as LunarVim or AtroVim.
I felt pride in building my own configuration. But, after spending countless amount of painful hours fixing things manually when some plugin decides to make some breaking changes out of nowhere.
I finally decided i would just switch to a pre-built config like Lazyvim or NvChad.</p>

<p>This is something that i have been working on for last couple of weeks.
<a href="https://github.com/krolyxon/rmptui">rmptui</a> is a tui music player whichworks with
<a href="https://www.musicpd.org/">MPD</a> (Music Player Daemon).</p>
<p>I had decided to make a music player in rust in the May of 2023, but i never got around to it.
It was two months ago when i actually started working on it, because i wanted to learn rust.</p>

<p>After watching countless amount of videos on the internet about,
how Microchips/Microprocessors are manufactured. I still to this day just believe its just f*cking magic.</p>
<p>I am aware of the steps and processes that are done to manufacture them, but
how the hell do you even do that bro???
like how the hell do you design 11 billion semiconductors in a silicon die that is just few millimeters in diameter.
holy shit.</p>
