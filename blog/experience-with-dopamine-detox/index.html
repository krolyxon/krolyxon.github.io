I decided to work on my lifestyle, and started dopamine detox, its been a week, and today i am going to share my experience with my dopamine detox.

<p>Few days ago i came to realize that from past few months i haven&rsquo;t had any creative thoughts and i hadn&rsquo;t done anything new at all. It was all the same, wake up, music, watch movies, videos on youtube, consume consume&hellip;..
I would spend all my day just consuming information on the internet and not doing any real work. My mind was being stimulated entire day, whether it be with music or youtube videos.
i wouldn&rsquo;t spend a single moment of my day without any kind of stimulation. Sleeping? just play a long youtube video and fall asleep listening to it. Getting ready for college? just play a music playlist in the background. Working out? just play workout playlist. Reading or studying a article? play Lofi music in background. this had a big impact on my creativity and thinking.
it was depressing, because when i was younger i was one of the most creative kids among other students in school, here i am being a coomer on the internet doing nothing but consuming online media.
I decided to work on my lifestyle, and started dopamine detox, its been a week, and today i am going to share my experience with my dopamine detox.</p>
<h2 id="rules-for-dopamine-detox">Rules for Dopamine Detox<a href="#rules-for-dopamine-detox" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<ol>
<li>No music while doing daily chores or work.</li>
<li>No social media, unless your friend tells you to watch some reel.</li>
<li>Spend at least 30 minutes reading a real book.</li>
<li>Even after you relapse. don&rsquo;t get depressed,  just restart.</li>
<li>Spend some time of the day doing nothing, that time you will have the most creative thoughts.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t do this for set amount of days, from now on this is your lifestyle. Forever.</li>
<li>Consume less, produce more.</li>
<li>Do one and only task at a time, no multitasking. Things might take more time to get done, but at least you will get them done.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="my-experience">My Experience<a href="#my-experience" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>The day i started Dopamine detox, i woke up and avoided listening to music while getting ready, i was already getting quick at doing things done. i wouldn&rsquo;t spend any time checking out social media or anything related to internet. i would just wake up, and start getting ready. Nothing else.
The whole day i was feeling like a wizard, i felt like i could get anything done. Be it homework, or any programming task, everything started to feel like i can do it.
My mind was calm, i got better at problem solving, i started getting more things done, and i felt like a god.
From last few days, this godly feeling hasn&rsquo;t gotten away, and today i am writing this blog to share it with you all.
Guess what, i even made a cool <a href="https://github.com/krolyxon/JavaCalc">GUI calculator</a> in Java (which i sucked at), i just sat down and did it, no constant stimulation in background, just work. My working speed has gotten insanely fast. i just feel like i can get done anything fast.
I dont feel like relapsing at all. I wish i had started living like this earlier.</p>
