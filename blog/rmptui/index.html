<p>This is something that i have been working on for last couple of weeks.
<a href="https://github.com/krolyxon/rmptui">rmptui</a> is a tui music player whichworks with
<a href="https://www.musicpd.org/">MPD</a> (Music Player Daemon).</p>
<p>I had decided to make a music player in rust in the May of 2023, but i never got around to it.
It was two months ago when i actually started working on it, because i wanted to learn rust.</p>
<p><img src="/img/rmptui-v0.1.4.png" alt="rmptui-v0.1.4">
Above pictures shows the directory browser tab of rmptui.
It has total three tabs:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Queue - Shows current playing queue</li>
<li>Directory browser - Lets you explore your music library</li>
<li>Playlists - Shows your playlists</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p>Get more info about keymaps from <a href="https://github.com/krolyxon/rmptui?tab=readme-ov-file#keys">Github Readme</a></p>
<h2 id="crates-used">Crates Used<a href="#crates-used" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>So rmptui uses <a href="https://crates.io/crates/mpd">rust-mpd</a> crate to interact with Music Player Daemon.
This crate is no longer maintained it seems, a lot of the commands are ambiguous,
and it was relatively annoying to work with it.
The better approach would be to just use TCP sockets, but anyways i found my ways to
work with this crate anyways.</p>
<p>It uses <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ratatui">ratatui</a> for the TUI (Terminal User Interface)
which is a pretty lightweight and intuitive library to cook TUIs.</p>
<h2 id="state-of-rmptui-right-now-2024-06-02">State of Rmptui right now (2024-06-02)<a href="#state-of-rmptui-right-now-2024-06-02" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>It is still in its early development days, where a lot of bugs are expected, so i kindly request
everyone to report bugs on <a href="https://github.com/krolyxon/rmptui/issues">Github Issues</a>, so i can fix them.
Currently it is in its version 0.1.4.</p>
<h2 id="future-plans">Future Plans<a href="#future-plans" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Right now rmptui is not asynchronous and is single threaded, which is really bad for a music player
that interacts with a server and handles keybinds and renders TUI at the same time.
I also plan to add support for lyrics fetching in future.
Also the codebase is a giant clusterf*ck, so i hope to organize that as well.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, release a stable v1.0.0 and public it on crates.io</p>
