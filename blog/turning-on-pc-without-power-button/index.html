        <p>So recently, my computer&rsquo;s power button stopped working.
i dont know what exactly happened to it, but it just stopped working.
now i was completely unable to boot my PC. i spent whole day without my computer,
thinking i would take it to a computer technician and fix it the next day.
but just for the sake of trying out, i tried figuring some way out myself.
I opened my PC&rsquo;s cabinate and searched for the cable which connects the motherboard and the power button(POWER SW cable).
I disconnected that cable from the motherboard and took a screwdriver and then trouched it to the
pins where the POWER SW cable was connected previously.
Voilah! the pc booted up.</p>
<p>The problem was it wouldn&rsquo;t completely boot to my operating and
gave me an error that the POWER SW cable was disconnected, obviously because i removed it.
but it did gave me an option to go to the BIOS menu by pressing F2.
After going to the BIOS menu i went to the &lsquo;Power Management&rsquo; section and then &lsquo;AC Recovery&rsquo; and
changed the &lsquo;Restore on AC Power Loss&rsquo; to &lsquo;Power On&rsquo; (its &lsquo;Power Off&rsquo; by default.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now if you just give electricity to your computer,
it will automatically turn on without the need of pressing the power button on your PC&rsquo;s case/cabinet.
So now, i dont need to spend money to fix the power button and it saves me a little bit of time by not having
to press the power button everytime i want to turn on my pc.</p>
