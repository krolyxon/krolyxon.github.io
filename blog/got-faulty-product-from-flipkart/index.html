I get a call from my mum that the RAM i ordered online has just arrived and i gotta be there to confirm the delivery and to verify that the product is right. I woke up immediately, in a rush without fixing my bed. i ran with happiness and excitement, and full of thoughts of what i am going to do after upgrading my laptopâ€™s ram. Confirmed the order, took the RAM, went back to my room. I was happy. I was excited.\nStage 2: Fear , Shocked. After getting back to my room, i started opening my laptopâ€™s back which has small plus/star screws with a huge flat head screwdriver ðŸ’€. i managed to open all the screws and the back panel withing 10 minutes, i installed the ram. After that my laptop booted into my Arch Linux (btw) without any issues, and i was still happy. To confirm that the ram has been installed correctly, i quickly ran neofetch, and this is where my happiness started turning into fear. the ram was still 8 Gb, when it should have been 8 + 16 = 24 Gb. Thinking that i just installed it incorrectly, i tried all different variations again, such as swapping the ram slots, using only the new ram, and all that. but it still wasnâ€™t working, and then i was sure that i just got an defected product. I was Afraid. I was Shocked.\nStage 3: Anger, Tears Now since it was for sure that i had gotten an defected RAM, i quickly opened up Flipkart and tried to find the Return button, and it turns out that this particular seller did not provide any return policies. I am not sure 100%, but i do believe it did said that it provides return policies and then the seller changed it, but we cant say for sure. I was really panicking. I called Flipkart customer support, and had a talk with the technician, and there he also confirmed that Flipkart cant help me since the product does not come under the refundable productâ€™s category. then i knew for sure, I am f*cked. I was Angry. I was Crying.\nStage 4: Acceptance After fuming and crying for about an hour, and talking with my friends on Matrix about it. i finally had just accepted it, and decided to write a article on it to share my feelings. I was broken but i was okay.\n","wordCount":"467","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-12-30T16:18:25+05:30","dateModified":"2023-12-30T16:18:25+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://krolyxon.github.io/blog/got-faulty-product-from-flipkart/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Krolyxon's webpage","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://krolyxon.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://krolyxon.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://krolyxon.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://krolyxon.github.io/blog title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://krolyxon.github.io/about/ title="About Me"><span>About Me</span></a></li><li><a href=https://krolyxon.github.io/contact/ title=Contact><span>Contact</span></a></li><li><a href=https://krolyxon.github.io/links/ title=Links><span>Links</span></a></li><li><a href=https://krolyxon.github.io/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://krolyxon.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;Â»&nbsp;<a href=https://krolyxon.github.io/blog/>Blogs</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Got Faulty Product From Flipkart</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-12-30 16:18:25 +0530 IST'>December 30, 2023</span>&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;467 words&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;Me</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#stage-1-excitement-happiness aria-label="Stage 1: Excitement, Happiness.">Stage 1: Excitement, Happiness.</a></li><li><a href=#stage-2-fear--shocked aria-label="Stage 2: Fear , Shocked.">Stage 2: Fear , Shocked.</a></li><li><a href=#stage-3-anger-tears aria-label="Stage 3: Anger, Tears">Stage 3: Anger, Tears</a></li><li><a href=#stage-4-acceptance aria-label="Stage 4: Acceptance">Stage 4: Acceptance</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>Today i got a faulty 16GB ram from Flipkart.
