<meta name=keywords content><meta name=description content="I switched to Brave Browser from Librewolf
Alright i have been making alot of switches these days, first it was switching to NvChad now this.
I previously used Librewolf, which was a more privacy focused browser based on Firefox, and to be honest it worked quite well.
It supported all the extensions/addons i needed, it had firefox sync, and the overall experience was nice.
One thing that was bugging me was performance, previously i was unaware that librewolf performed worse compared to other chromium based browser.
I had to install a chromium based browser for my college work for some time, and there i experienced some speed, real speed.
And i fell into the trap and now i am using a chromium based browser as my default browser. There are lots of things that i am missing from librewolf,
such as smooth scrolling and mouse gestures (i miss them), its UI and firefox sync, but speed is something i always prioritize over anything else, so brave it is."><meta name=author content="Me"><link rel=canonical href=https://krolyxon.github.io/blog/switched-to-brave/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.d6fcd20a4fb86efa4dfac8ec95da60244cc8871042183da1ef28e3a762ad79c8.css integrity="sha256-1vzSCk+4bvpN+sjsldpgJEzIhxBCGD2h7yjjp2Ktecg=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://krolyxon.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://krolyxon.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://krolyxon.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://krolyxon.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://krolyxon.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://krolyxon.github.io/blog/switched-to-brave/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://krolyxon.github.io/blog/switched-to-brave/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Krolyxon's webpage"><meta property="og:title" content="Switched to Brave"><meta property="og:description" content="I switched to Brave Browser from Librewolf Alright i have been making alot of switches these days, first it was switching to NvChad now this.
