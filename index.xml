      <description>I officially switched to NvChad Throughout my journey of using Neovim, i always avoided using a pre-built config or any distribution of neovim such as LunarVim or AtroVim. I felt pride in building my own configuration. But, after spending countless amount of painful hours fixing things manually when some plugin decides to make some breaking changes out of nowhere. I finally decided i would just switch to a pre-built config like Lazyvim or NvChad.</description>

      <description>How it all began This is something that i have been working on for last couple of weeks. rmptui is a tui music player whichworks with MPD (Music Player Daemon).
I had decided to make a music player in rust in the May of 2023, but i never got around to it. It was two months ago when i actually started working on it, because i wanted to learn rust.</description>

      <description>Why i think that way. After watching countless amount of videos on the internet about, how Microchips/Microprocessors are manufactured. I still to this day just believe its just f*cking magic.
I am aware of the steps and processes that are done to manufacture them, but how the hell do you even do that bro??? like how the hell do you design 11 billion semiconductors in a silicon die that is just few millimeters in diameter.</description>

      <description>My Experience with Dopamine Detox Few days ago i came to realize that from past few months i haven&amp;rsquo;t had any creative thoughts and i hadn&amp;rsquo;t done anything new at all. It was all the same, wake up, music, watch movies, videos on youtube, consume consume&amp;hellip;.. I would spend all my day just consuming information on the internet and not doing any real work. My mind was being stimulated entire day, whether it be with music or youtube videos.</description>

Stage 1: Excitement, Happiness. it was 10 am in the morning, i was sleeping. I get a call from my mum that the RAM i ordered online has just arrived and i gotta be there to confirm the delivery and to verify that the product is right.</description>

      <description>Recently, i got myself a laptop (a gaming one) for college work, and the battery life was fine on windows (which it came preinstalled with) because windows by default does battery power optimizations preserve battery life. When i installed Arch Linux on it, the battery life was disappointing. On windows my laptop would last for about 3 hours and on the other hand on linux, it would barely reach 2 hours&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Syncing keepass database between android and desktop with rsync</title>

      <description>Introduction to keepass Everyone should use password managers, because remembering unique passwords is difficult. There are many great password FOSS password managers such as bitwarden, keepass, keepassxc etc. I wouldnt recommend using bitwarden because its cloud based, Your password database is being stored in cloud, and it makes me really paranoid. because there are thousands of users using it, so a lot of hackers trying to hack bitwarden&amp;rsquo;s server. bitwarden allows you to self-host it, so you can host it in your own server.</description>

      <guid>https://krolyxon.github.io/blog/turning-on-pc-without-power-button/</guid>
      <description>So recently, my computer&amp;rsquo;s power button stopped working. i dont know what exactly happened to it, but it just stopped working. now i was completely unable to boot my PC. i spent whole day without my computer, thinking i would take it to a computer technician and fix it the next day. but just for the sake of trying out, i tried figuring some way out myself. I opened my PC&amp;rsquo;s cabinate and searched for the cable which connects the motherboard and the power button(POWER SW cable).</description>

      <title>Lineage OS 19 on Moto g60</title>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;Clean&amp;rsquo; Android experience As i have said in my home page, i dont use cell phones that much but i do own a moto g60, because it has become impossible to live without a cell phone in this modern era.
The reason i chose to buy a motorola phone instead of those sh*tty compenies like xiaomi, vivo, oppo etc. was because my friend (well i dont have any, its just a ehh friend not friend friend) told me that Motorola phones are &amp;lsquo;privacy&amp;rsquo; friendly and provide clean android experience.</description>
